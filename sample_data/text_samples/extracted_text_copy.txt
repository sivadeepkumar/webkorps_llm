available. Please contact Cryoport Systems’ Customer Service and Logistics
Management team for more information.

instructions in the Additional Instructions or Comments field located on
Step 3 – Documentation Order Information (see page 34). For shipments
to be sent at the beginning of the business week, we recommend selecting

Cryoport Systems recommends the use of a specialty courier (e.g.
CRYOPDP) for Leg 2 shipments. Please note that international shipments
using a specialty courier require advance notice to allow for pre-clearance and
booking processes. International Leg 2 shipments sent via a standard courier
require that the exporter and importer have confirmed the documentation and
other regulatory requirements in advance.
33.2.6. For standard courier service, select “Cryoport FedEx” for the Shipping
Account and “Priority Overnight” or “International Priority” for the Service
Level.
33.2.7. For specialty courier services, select the appropriate specialty courier for the
Shipping Account and the corresponding transit time for the Service Level.
33.3.
For 4 Leg Shipments: Repeat step 33.2 for Leg 3 as prompted.
38

33.4.
Leg 3: Return empty equipment to Cryoport Systems.
33.4.1. Request shipper(s) pickup from the Destination site (Leg 3 pickup).
33.4.2. By default, Cryoport Systems will ship Leg 3 via a standard courier with

Systems logistics center, Cryoport Systems may collect the equipment via the
Cryoshuttle® instead. For other courier options or any special requests on the
Leg 3 service, please enter your instructions in the Additional Instructions
or Comments field located on Step 3 – Documentation Order Information
(see page 34).
33.4.3. Select the Pickup Date and Pickup Time. To help ensure that the equipment
is returned to Cryoport Systems in a timely manner and to avoid extended
lease fees, we recommend scheduling the Leg 3 pickup one business day
after the Leg 2 delivery. Please note that all commodities should be removed
from the shipper(s) as soon as possible after Leg 2 delivery.
33.4.4. Once completed, click Save & Continue to proceed.
